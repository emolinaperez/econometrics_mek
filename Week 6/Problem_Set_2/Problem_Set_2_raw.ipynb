    "All else equal, it is thought that housing prices are NEGATIVELY related to air pollution. However, it is not clear how much air pollution actually affects property values, and you are hired to estimate the causal impact of air pollution on housing prices. To do this, you have a county-level panel dataset with information on average air pollution levels, $S$, median housing prices, $Y$; and a vector of other covariates, $X$ (such as the unemployment rate, average income, fraction of sunny days, and manufacturing output). There are 2,463 muncipilaties in Mexico, and you have 12 years worth of data for each municipality, starting in 1970."

State a mathematical condition on the relationship between air pollution and the other factors that affect $Y$ that would imply that the regression coefficient is a \"credible\" estimate (in the sense that it is a consistent estimate) of the causal effect of pollution. Provide one reason why this condition could fail in this situation."
